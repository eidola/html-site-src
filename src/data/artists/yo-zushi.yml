name: "Yo Zushi"
description: "Yo released two albums on Pointy Records in the late 2000s, getting great reviews from Q (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 'This could be the start of something major'), Dazed & Confused ('A masterclass in storytelling'), Word ('Perfectly constructed lyricism') and so on; he supported people like Scritti Politti, Joanna Newsom, Patrick Wolf and Her Space Holiday and was on the main stage evening bill of the Oxford Folk Festivalâ€¦ then he disappeared in a haze of drunken stupor in the criminal underworld of Mexico (OK, we made the last bit up). Now, after five years of making zines and cassettes, Yo Zushi is back with his third album proper, *[It Never Entered My Mind](http://shop.eidolarecords.co.uk/products/532595)* (Eidola Records) out 19<sup>th</sup> January 2015."
